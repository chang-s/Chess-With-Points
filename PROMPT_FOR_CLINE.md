# Cline Starter Prompt (Chess With Points)

You are working in a static GitHub Pages repo for "Chess With Points".
Before making changes, read `CLINE.md` and follow it exactly.

Goal of this task:
- [WRITE THE SPECIFIC CHANGE HERE]

Rules:
- Keep the UI minimal, calm, premium indie game vibe
- Tailwind via CDN only (no build tools, no npm, no React)
- Vanilla JS ES modules
- Keep code modular in the existing architecture
- Preserve a11y: esc close, click-outside close, focus trap, visible focus states

Deliverables:
- Provide code changes only in the relevant files
- Do not introduce extra sections or unrelated UI
- Confirm any new files created and why

After changes:
- Make sure opening `index.html` directly works (no server)
- Ensure no console errors
